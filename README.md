# CAE_MTRNN_end2end

- CAE: convolutional auto encoder
image feature extraction
input images and reconstruct images. You can extract the image feature value from the mid laryer

- MTRNN: multiple timescales recurrent neural networks
integrate angle data and image feature.
input data(t) -> output data(t+1) i.e. predictive learning
for generate motions
